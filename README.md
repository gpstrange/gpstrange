### Hi, I'm Guru Prasad (aka GpStrange) 👋

I am a crazy coder, caffine lover and a stranger to you (perhaps). I write code to keep myself busy. Technically, I'm a full stack JavaScript developer, cofounder of [Cubernest](http://cubernest.com/).

- 📱  I am now working at [Gamenous](http://gamenous.com/).
- 🌱  I am currently learning JavaScript (Since 2017).
